Question1:

a) swap (x, y) = (y, x)

   if x is type t1 and y is type t2, then the function will be the type (t2, t1)
   
   swap :: (t1,t2) -> (t2, t1)
   swap (x, y) = (y, x)



b) pair x y = (x, y)

   if x is type t1 and y is type t2, then the function will be the type (t1, t2)

   pair :: t1 -> t2 -> (t1, t2)
   pair x y = (x, y)


c) double x = x*2

   From the function, we assume that the x should be the numeric type, if the x is 
   type numeric type t1, then the function should also be the numeric type t1

   double :: Num t1 => t1 -> t1
   double x = x*2


d) twice f x = f(f(x))

   From the function, we can assume it is a function f take x as a single argument with
   any type (such as type t1), and x will has the same type with function f, and the 
   function will return the same type (t1)

   twice :: (t1 -> t1) -> t1 -> t1
   twice f x = f(f(x))
